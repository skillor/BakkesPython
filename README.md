# PythonPlugin

## Plugin info
This is a Bakkesmod plugin which integrates a python interpreter and python bindings to the bakkesmod sdk. This is a extremely early release. Stuff will probably not work as expected. And there is quite limited support for python intellisense.

## TODO
Reload button crashes, reload command not

unload python interpreter

intellisense for python module

better setup (include python)
